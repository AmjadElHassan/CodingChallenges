        <p>question: <br>
            To complete this Kata you need to make a function multiplyAll/multiply_all which takes an array of integers as an argument. This function must return another function, which takes a single integer as an argument and returns a new array.
            The returned array should consist of each of the elements from the first array multiplied by the integer.<br>
            <h2>Developer notes</h2>
            <p>Very good fundamentals problem. This is the first time I have used currying! I thought this was a good introduction into the topic, but mechanically, the program is pretty simple.
            Use multiplyAll([arrayOfNumbers])(integer) in console to test.<br>
        currying is when we break down a function that takes multiple arguments into a series of functions that each only take one argument. this is convenient because it works on the premise that a program can gradually gain more arguments as a program continues</p>
