        <h1>Coding challenge 11</h1>
        <p>problem: <br>The new "Avengers" movie has just been released! There are a lot of people at the cinema box office standing in a huge line. Each of them has a single 100, 50 or 25 dollar bill. An "Avengers" ticket costs 25 dollars.

            Vasya is currently working as a clerk. He wants to sell a ticket to every single person in this line.
            
            Can Vasya sell a ticket to every person and give change if he initially has no money and sells the tickets strictly in the order people queue?
            
            Return YES, if Vasya can sell a ticket to every person and give change with the bills he has at hand at that moment. Otherwise return NO.

            use tickets(arrayofpeople) eh. tickets([25,25,25,50,25,100,50,50,25])
        </p>
        <h2>Developer notes</h2>
        <p>much like the last few challenges, i use array manipulation to keep track of the money in the register and then arranged them from largest to smallest, and cycled through them to see if a combo existed to repay the change. if not, the while loop is broken, peopleInLine will not equal to 0 and we will receive a false statement</p>
        <p>a particularly clever solution i found utilized a constructor to keep track of multiple functions and type of bills using object manipulation. i have to keep that option in the front of my mind for future problems. I think i'm getting better at pseudocode. really helps clarify when things start gettign complicated</p>
