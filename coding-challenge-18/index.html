    <h1>Coding challenge 18</h1>
    <p>question: <br>
        In a factory a printer prints labels for boxes. For one kind of boxes the printer has to use colors which, for the sake of simplicity, are named with letters from a to m.<br>

The colors used by the printer are recorded in a control string. For example a "good" control string would be aaabbbbhaijjjm meaning that the printer used three times color a, four times color b, one time color h then one time color a...<br>

Sometimes there are problems: lack of colors, technical malfunction and a "bad" control string is produced e.g. aaaxbbbbyyhwawiwjjjwwm with letters not from a to m.<br>

You have to write a function printer_error which given a string will return the error rate of the printer as a string representing a rational whose numerator is the number of errors and the denominator the length of the control string. Don't reduce this fraction to a simpler expression.<br>

The string has a length greater or equal to one and contains only letters from ato z.<br>

Examples:<br>
s="aaabbbbhaijjjm"<br>
error_printer(s) => "0/14"<br>

s="aaaxbbbbyyhwawiwjjjwwm"<br>
error_printer(s) => "8/22"<br>
