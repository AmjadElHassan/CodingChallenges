        <h1>Coding challenge 12</h1>
        <p>question: <br> Write a function, which takes a non-negative integer (seconds) as input and returns the time in a human-readable format (HH:MM:SS)

            HH = hours, padded to 2 digits, range: 00 - 99
            MM = minutes, padded to 2 digits, range: 00 - 59
            SS = seconds, padded to 2 digits, range: 00 - 59
            The maximum time never exceeds 359999 (99:59:59)
            
            You can find some examples in the test fixtures. To test please enter humanReadable(seconds) into the console
        </p>
        <h2>Developer notes</h2>
        <p>There was 2 methods I considered engaging this problem. i could divide the entire seconds by 3600(to convert from seconds to hours). i have a whole integer for hours. to get remaining minutes we multiply the fraction leftover by 60. then to get seconds, multiply the remaining fraction of minutes by 60. the other method, which is the one i chose, is more dependent on the modulus. i divide the entire given seconds by 3600 and round down to get hours. then computing seconds modulus 3600 i get remaining total seconds. i divide that and round down to get the remaining minutes. adding 1 more layer to this and computing (((seconds%3600)%60)%60) gives me the leftover seconds after computing for minutes and hours</p>
        <br>
        <p>i did learn a new method. it is called the padStart() method. essentially it returns a string back with a minimum number of characters (adds padding), and fills those spaces with a character of your choosing. so in this exercise, for example, hours (an integer number) is returned as hours.toString().toPad(2,'0')</p>
        <h3>best practice</h3>
        <p>the best practice i found used parseInt function to pull whole numbers from the calculations. just as well, it actually really illuminated a logical shortcut i could have taken. seconds%60, will return me the leftover seconds without even having to run through the previous hour and minute calculations. the hours integer is simply seconds/60/60.<br>own minutes is (seconds/60)%60. minutes logic was tripping me up reading his code for a moment. but total seconds divided by 60 does give total minutes. but then i modulus it by 60, why? because 60 minutes = 1 hour. therefore to get leftover minutes after hours are accounted for, we return whatever minutes don't equal a full 60 minutes.</p>
