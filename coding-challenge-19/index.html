    <h1>Coding challenge 19</h1>
    <pre>question:
        Write a function that combines two arrays by alternatingly taking elements from each array in turn.

        Points:

        The arrays may be of different lengths, with at least one character/digit.
        One array will be of string characters (in lower case, a-z), a second of integers (all positive starting at 1).
        use mergeArrays() in console to demonstrate    
    </pre>

    <p> Not a super challenging problem, but this was a great chance for me to really hone in on my pseudocode.
